# PyTrade
A cryptocurrency trading framework written in Python that will allow users to define, run, and manage their own trading strategies. It is currently under heavy development and will be for the foreseeable future. I intend to create a web interface and/or a GUI for CRUD operations in the future as well. I will also use MongoDB to store configurations, API credentials, and records of trades.

# History
I originally began this project in the spring of 2020 during the global Covid-19 pandemic. It has changed and evolved in more ways than I could have ever imagined as I  (self) learned: how to trade, different programming techniques, what databases are, GitHub, the difference between the front-end and back-end, and how to debug.
