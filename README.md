# PyTrade
PyTrade is a cryptocurrency trading framework written in Python that will allow users to define, run, and manage their own trading strategies. It is currently under heavy development and will be for the foreseeable future. I also intend to create a web interface and/or a GUI for CRUD operations and will use MongoDB to store configurations, API credentials, and records of trades.

# History
I began this project in the spring of 2020 during the onset of the global Covid-19 pandemic. It has evolved and changed in more ways than I could have ever imagined as I learned: the fundementals and logistics of trading, programming techniques, databases, GitHub, the difference between the front-end and back-end, and how to debug.
